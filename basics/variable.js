const accountId = 154655 // const variable is constant if it declared it can't be changed after.
let accountEmail = "neerajpandey.google.com" // let variable can be changed after declaring and its a better way to declare a variable if you need to change it .
var accountPassword = "123458"// var variable is also like let but it's rearly used because it has some flause and issues.
accountCity = "Delhi" // you can also declare a variable without writing the const , let or var . but its not recommended.
let accountState; // in this variable without giving the values you can declared it and give storage. this is used when the values want to give later but you need the space.

console.log(accountId) // this is used to print the variable values.

console.table([accountId,accountEmail,accountPassword,accountCity, accountState]) // this is used to print variable values in tabular form.
